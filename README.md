# Git Tutorial

Hello! This is a tutorial repository designed to teach you [git!](0)

`git` is one of the most important pieces of software that has ever existed. It enables [version control](1) and [distributed collaboration](2), which is the most meaningful and popular way that modern software is created.

This tutorial is intended for early learners in the world of command-line utilities, programming, and of course, `git` usage. No previous programming knowledge is necessary. This tutorial assumes that you would like to learn more about how command line interfaces (CLIs) work in a general sense, in addition to learning `git`. For this reason, the first chapter covers how to use many common CLI programs and what they are used for. There are other, better tutorials for learning all of the ins and outs of using a terminal in a linux-like environment - therefore, this section will not be exhaustive, and will only serve the purpose of getting us to a point where we can navigate the command line and understand command line tools well enough to use `git`.

Since this tutorial assumes no foreknowledge of `git` or programming, the only prerequisite for this course is that you have a terminal or terminal emulator of some kind installed on your machine. Check the following bullets if you need help installing one:

- If you are using Windows, consider [Git for Windows](3) for a tailored `git` experience that lives in your Windows machine, or [WSL](4) for a less integrated experience that gives you access to more command-line interface tools.
- If you are using MacOS, use Finder to search for Terminal.
- If you are using a Linux operating system, most support `Ctrl-Alt-T` as a shortcut for opening the terminal.

This tutorial will be divided into lessons, which are the directories of this project. You can view the first lesson here: [LESSON 0](/lessons/0/README.md).
