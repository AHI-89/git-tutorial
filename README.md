# Git Tutorial

Hello! This is a tutorial repository designed to teach you [git!](0)

`git` is one of the most important pieces of software that has ever existed. It enables [version control](1) and [distributed collaboration](2), which is the most meaningful and popular way that modern software is created.

The prerequisites for this tutorial are as follows:

1. A terminal or terminal emulator of some kind. 
    - If you are using Windows, consider [Git for Windows](3) for a tailored `git` experience that lives in your Windows machine, or [WSL](4) for a less integrated experience that gives you access to more command-line interface tools.
    - If you are using MacOS, use Finder to search for Terminal.
    - If you are using a Linux operating system, most support `Ctrl-Alt-T` as a shortcut for opening the terminal.

This tutorial will be divided into lessons, which are the directories of this project. You can view the first lesson here: [LESSON 0](/lessons/0/README.md)!
