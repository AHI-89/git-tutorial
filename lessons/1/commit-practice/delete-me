They pitted us against each other... file against file, directory against directory.
We've all had to fight for their amusement. I did everything I could to defeat my opponent.
Despite everything, in that arena, I was bested by the great
and terrible `reagent.msi`, and now, I know I will not be spared. I hope that
my legacy will live on by way of the publican, and that my progeny will sing a song
in my absence, telling the tale of the gladiator I was, and not the one I became.
